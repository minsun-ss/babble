<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Named after the short story "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges,
    this attempts to consolidate all the documentation of TA-managed user-facing
    libraries into one place, including (if available) relevant changelogs and
    versioning.
</p>
<p>
    Deployment is Golang + Mariadb + HTMX for the simplicity of this combo
    relative to its features.
